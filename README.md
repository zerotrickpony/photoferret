# What is Photo Ferret?

**Photoferret** is a free, unopinionated **photo manager app** that runs on your Mac, Windows, or Linux computer. You can use it to browse and organize photos, videos, artwork, or image-like projects. It is currently an alpha quality prototype which I personally use and develop. I built it for people who have a lot of photos and need to view and organize them quickly. I work on Photoferret in my spare time, so it's not my job or anything. I hope you like it!

### What it isn't:

- Photoferret is **not a cloud service**, website, or storage system. It doesn't replace Flickr or Google Photos or iCloud. It works completely offline. It doesn't send your photos anywhere. It doesn't do any "AI" anything. It's just a desktop app for managing the images once they reach your computer.
- Photoferret is **not a phone app**. It doesn't work on Android or iPhone. I will work on some sync features for phones later but it's not a phone app.
- Photoferret is **not for commercial use**. Photoferret is intended for personal use. I'm also delighted to have use by non-profits, students, and individual artists. If you plan to use it within a multi-person corporation of any sort, [please ask me first.](mailto:dev@zerotrickpony.com) I'm currently approving for-profit uses by individual artists and employee-owned cooperatives.

### What it does:

- **Manages large collections** on your local disk, NAS, or USB drives. Photoferret should be able to index over 100,000 photos on a fast laptop without bogging down.
- **Leaves your photos where they are.** It does not need to import, move, modify, or copy any of your images in order to work. Even editing actions like crop, straighten, tagging, and color correction work on an overlay that does not change your photos on disk. Your files and folders won't change unless you want them to.
- Manages **multiple independent collections** of images. Do you have image projects, vacation photos, and artwork that you'd prefer to keep separate? I sure do. Photoferret easily lets you browse amongst multiple separate folders without mingling them together. You can make one huge collection or many small ones. Up to you.
- **Quickly browse, sort, and search**. Photoferret maintains a fast index of your photos and videos so you can view your collections in different ways easily: by date, by name, by folder tree, by tag, by similarity, etc.
- **Use powerful tools.** Photoferret lets you bulk move, copy, export, crop, straighten, color-correct, tag, stack, and caption your photos quickly.
